                        <h4>Our Impact</h4>
                        <p>The last 5 years have been a time of aligning goals, and building synergistic partnerships with major hospital chains and diagnostic clinics to find deserving patients. Impact Guru Foundation continues to explore all possible ways of reaching the most vulnerable and deserving people in our society who are in need of life-saving medical treatment. We are fortunate to have partners among corporates and NGOs who share our values and commitment and have been working with us for the better part of these 5 years. When we look back on the past 5 years, we see the impact of our joint achievements and look to further the reach of our philanthropic activities. We have managed to save thousands of lives and put the smile back on the face of the families of the deserving patients. The strategic partnerships we have forged along the way are the pillars on which we will build future projects.</p>
